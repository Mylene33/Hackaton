                randon was born in 2021 on the occasion of a hackaton. Three junior front-end developpers Yousra, Mylene and Tom were challenged by the twilio company to build a not for profit application in only 24 hours. 
                The trio came with the idea of Ran'don whithin a few seconds. It was obvious ! What about creating a very simple app that helps people to decide on which charity theyâ€™ll make a donation!
